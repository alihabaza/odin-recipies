    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Preperation</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the grape leaves in cold water and drain.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice in warm water for 10-15 minutes, then drain.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Filling</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the drained rice, chopped tomatoes, onion, parsley, dill, and mint. Add the ground beef/lamb if using.</li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and allspice. Drizzle with olive oil and half of the lemon juice. Mix well.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Assembling</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay a grape leaf flat on a work surface, vein side up and stem towards you. Cut off the stem.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of filling near the stem end. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll tightly away from you.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Cooking</strong>
        <ol>

            <li>Place a plate upside down over the leaves to keep them submerged. Cover the pot with a lid.</li>
            <li>Cook over low heat for about 45-60 minutes or until the leaves are tender and the filling is cooked.</li>
        </ol>
