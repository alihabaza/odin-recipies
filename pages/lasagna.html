    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg"width = '400', length = '400'>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish composed of layers of flat lasagna noodles, alternating with fillings such as ragù (meat sauce),
         vegetables, cheeses (like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano, and basil.
          The dish is then topped with cheese and baked until the cheese is bubbly and the edges of the pasta are golden and crispy.
